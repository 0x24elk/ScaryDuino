Animated Halloween Pumpkin Eyes - Arduino Style

This is my version of [Michal T Janyst's project](https://mjanyst.weebly.com/arduino-pumpkin-eyes.html).
Loved the idea and wanted to build my own.

I did look at the original project and code for inspiration (e.g., for the hardware and
which animations to use). But I wrote my own code from scratch, so I decided this might
be worth uploading.
