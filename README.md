## Acknoledgements

This is my version of [Michal T Janyst's project](https://mjanyst.weebly.com/arduino-pumpkin-eyes.html). 
I loved the idea and wanted to build my own for some Halloween fun.

While I did look at the original project for inspiration (e.g., for the hardware and
which animations to use), I wrote the code from scratch. Maybe someone finds this
version more useful/interesting (but do check out the original, too).
